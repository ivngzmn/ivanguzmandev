                Hey, Iâ€™m Ivan. I'm a Software Engineer and I first got into programming when
                I working as a customer service supervisor at an e-commerce website.
                I taught myself how to use their custom content management system to
                update outdated product descriptions in order to alleviate load on
                repeated calls.
              </p>

            <div className="mt-5 prose prose-indigo text-gray-500 mx-auto lg:max-w-none lg:row-start-1 lg:col-start-1">
              <p>
                Then in I went on to work at Uber Technologies where my passion for
                programming grew further as I was persuaded by my team lead to
                pursue my dream software engineering. Unfortunately, the pandemic
                hit and the Uber in person office closed, so I shifted gears to not
                ever wanting this to happen again. So, I began to practice my
                Software Engineering skills over the past year.
              </p>

                I grew up in small-town in California and went to school at
                Fullerton College where I studied art and dabbled a bit with
                Networking Security. When I am not deep in code I spend my free
                tending to my coral reef aquarium, being a father, and enjoying time
                with friends and family in Brea, CA.
