                Hey, Iâ€™m Ivan. I first got into programming when I working as a
                customer service supervisor at an e-commerce website. I taught
                myself how to use their custom content management system to
                update outdated product descriptions in order to alleviate load
                on repeated calls.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-5">
                Then in I went on to work at Uber Technologies where my passion
                for programming grew further as I was persuaded by my team lead
                to pursue my dream software engineering. Unfortunately, the
                pandemic hit and the Uber in person office closed, so I shifted
                gears to not ever wanting this to happen again. So, I began to
                practice my Software Engineering skills over the past year.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-5">
                I grew up in small-town in California and went to school at
                Fullerton College where I studied art and dabbled a bit with
                Networking Security. When I am not deep in code I spend my free
                tending to my coral reef aquarium, being a father, and enjoying
                time with friends and family in Brea, CA.
