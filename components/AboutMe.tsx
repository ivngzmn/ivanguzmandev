                        <p>
                          Hey, Iâ€™m Ivan. Before pursuing software engineering, I
                          studied fine art with an emphasis in 3D graphics. I
                          started my software engineering journey through
                          working as a customer service supervisor at an
                          e-commerce website. I taught myself how to use their
                          custom content management system that used Bootstrap
                          for styling to update outdated product descriptions in
                          order to alleviate load on repeated calls. I got
                          sucked in pretty quickly, and found myself wanting to
                          learn more and more.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mt-5">
                          Then in I went on to work at Uber Technologies where
                          my passion for programming grew further as I was
                          persuaded by my team lead to pursue my dream software
                          engineering. Unfortunately, the pandemic hit and the
                          Uber in person office closed, so I shifted gears to
                          not ever wanting this to happen again. So, I began to
                          practice my Software Engineering skills until landing
                          a role at the 100devs web development agency.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mt-5">
                          I grew up in small-town in California and went to
                          school at Fullerton College where I studied art and
                          dabbled a bit with Networking Security. When I am not
                          deep in code I spend my free tending to my coral reef
                          aquarium, being a father, and enjoying time with
                          friends and family.
