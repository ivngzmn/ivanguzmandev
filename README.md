# Next.js 12 + Tailwind CSS Portfolio

My portfolio is made with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) [(v2.2)](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/tailwindcss-2-2) and Next.js. It uses the new [`Just-in-Time Mode`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode) for Tailwind CSS. Still a work in progress so not guarantee that it will work on your machine ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

## Deploy your own

Deploy the your own boilerplate using Vercel:
